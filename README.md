# Sudoku Assistance

 A vanilla JS app that helps the users with their Sudoku Puzzles.
 The live version can be found at [Sudoku Assistance](https://aykut-a.github.io/Sudoku-Assistance/).
 
 The user first needs to fill out the pre-given numbers in the app. Then the app will attempt to solve the Sudoku. 
 If the users wants to go on by themeselves or the app fails to solve the puzzle, the user is given control again.
 The app can also be used as only a template for sudokus if the user does not want any assistance.
